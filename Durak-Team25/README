Hello!
This is an AI project by: Yam Fine, Artume Pichersky, Miryam Yakubov, Nadav Finkel

We have implemented MiniMax algorithms (AlphaBetPruning, ExpectiMax, Minimax) along side with Gentic
Algorithm.
There are quiet a few parameters to play around with, feel free to explore them with -h.

Here are some execution options:
1. Play against AI : --opponent ExpectimaxAgent --depth 2
2. Explore AI work : --agent ExpectimaxAgent --depth 2
